# Rules for The Tavern Discord server.
# These rules are given specific numbers, unlike the FAQ, so they can be referenced.

1:
  rule: No Malicious Behavior.
  explanation:
    - >
      Do not enter the server with the intent to raid, brigade, or troll. Intentionally
      malicious users will be immediately and permanently banned. Come on, people, it’s
      common sense.
2:
  rule: No Obscene Content.
  explanation:
    - >
      This is a SFW server. Any form of porn/hentai/etc, including links or pics, is
      forbidden. Erotic roleplay (ERP) is also strictly prohibited. If you must, take it
      to PMs and fade to black.
3:
  rule: No Spam.
  explanation:
    - >
      Posting large numbers of superfluous messages for the purposes of cluttering a
      channel or artificially boosting server rank is prohibited. Express yourself with
      quality, not by volume.
4:
  rule: No Links.
  explanation:
    - >
      Posting of outside links has been disabled in most channels due to malicious user
      behaviour. If you would like to post a link and cannot, ping (@) an online member
      of Staff and we will be happy to assist.
5:
  rule: No Advertising.
  explanation:
    - >
      Refrain from advertising your own content (YouTube, Twitch, Discord, Social Media,
      etc) in a public channel without written permission from the Staff. Exceptions may
      be made if it is specifically related to the channel and discussion you are in
      (e.g.: if you are an artist in #music-arts-crafts; answering a question in
      #player-help; if you have been approved for #streaming, etc). That said, PMing
      links to other users who have asked for them is permitted. "
6:
  rule: Be Civil.
  explanation:
    - >
      You are free to engage in polite discussions and intellectual debates; in fact, we
      encourage it - passionate users are the best! However, avoid sliding into public
      arguments that distract from the topic. Do not insult or harangue other users, and
      do not return fire if you are insulted. Do not engage with trolls: ignore trolling
      attempts and report them to staff.
7:
  rule: No Bullying.
  explanation:
    - >
      Banter and teasing are fine, as long as it’s in good fun. However, discrimination
      or hate speech based on race, sex, gender, age, or sexuality is unacceptable. Racial
      slurs are specifically prohibited. If you are being bullied/harassed (even in PMs),
      feel free to report it to any member of Staff.
8:
  rule: Complaints Are Welcome.
  explanation:
    - >
      If you have a complaint about Staff or user behaviour, you are welcome to PM any
      online Staff at any level. If your complaint pertains to a member of Staff, take
      it one level higher to a Bartender, Innkeeper or Lord, as appropriate. If possible,
      bring evidence of misconduct, such as a screenshot, since it will make our job
      significantly easier! If the evidence is edited/deleted, contact a Lord, who can
      check the Deleted Messages Archive.
9:
  rule: Respect Staff Decisions.
  explanation:
    - >
      The Staff reserve the right to make decisions at their own discretion. Do not
      attempt to have one or more other uninvolved Staff members change or reverse that
      decision. That said, if you are being unfairly treated, please bring it to the
      attention of a higher Staff member, as per Rule 8. Not even Staff are above the law.
10:
  rule: No Impersonation.
  explanation:
    - >
      Do not attempt to impersonate server Staff. The job is thankless and the Innkeeper
      pays us in Copper Pieces, if at all. Don’t make our lives harder.

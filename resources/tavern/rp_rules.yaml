# Roleplay rules for The Tavern Discord server.
# These rules are given specific numbers, unlike the FAQ, so they can be referenced.

1:
  rule: No ERP.
  explanation:
    - >
      Any evidence of erotic roleplay will be punished, to allow as many players as possible to take part
      in and enjoy the roleplaying experience here, we need to keep this age appropriate; any descriptions
      of characters based purely on sexual characteristics are deemed inappropriate. Sexual harassment or
      misbehaviour will result in an instant RP Ban.
2:
  rule: Respect.
  explanation:
    - >
      Just treat fellow players with common decency, don't be cruel to anyone, especially if they're
      asking for advice, at the same time, we understand that debates can break out but when they do keep
      in mind that you are on a public platform and it's disrespectful to other players to be having large
      debates.
3:
  rule:
    Keep OOC, OOC.
  explanation:
    - >
      Out of character content should stay limited to the out of character channel, any content posted in
      main hall and the other roleplaying channels should be deleted, and if you have to declare the
      result from a roll or request another player make a roll just use the recommended format laid out
      later on in the document.
4:
  rule:
    Approved Characters.
  explanation:
    - >
      Please understand that in order to avoid any chaos created from having waves of unbalanced or unfair
      characters you need to wait to have your character sheet approved by a Roleplay DM. To get your
      character approved make sure you follow the character creation rules as laid out later on in the
      document.
5:
  rule:
    Leave the DMing to the DMs.
  explanation:
    - >
      Unless you ask a Roleplay DM, please leave DMing to the DMs; If there is an arc event going on and
      you need a DM to help keep things going or make an event occur, just hop into an out of character
      channel and ping the Roleplay DM you need or do a role ping for any Roleplay DM to come in.
6:
  rule:
    Avoid Spotlighting.
  explanation:
    - >
      We understand you want your character to have a strong personality and that you want your character
      to have character, but to keep things fair please avoid spotlighting (Trying to steal all the focus
      on a scene) unless it's a specific arc that really is all about you, and even then, best to stay
      respectful of your fellow players.
7:
  rule:
    Common Sense.
  explanation:
    - >
      Unless any events spark new rules to be written here, that should be all the basic rules we need,
      just use your common sense, be respectful, and remember to enjoy yourself while keeping things
      enjoyable for others!
8:
  rule:
    RTFM.
  explanation:
    - >
      Head on over here to the Public Google Drive for The Tavern and read the Player's Manual,
      known as Rosegrove's Journal of Eden, once you've done that check out our stuff in the Rules,
      Homebrew, and Resources folders, including such hits as Poisons, Mousefolk, Alchemists,
      and much much more! https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IwfCygfjoQXQ5flXxeWbeG6pSgkBKC-V

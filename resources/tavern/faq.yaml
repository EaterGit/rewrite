       Typically, you won't be able to find one-on-one help through DMs. However, the
       public #player-help and #dm-help channels to ask any questions you may have.
       Youtube series can also help you out. Several content creators have dedicated
       entire playlists to the topic. The Lords recommend the How to Play D&D 5e series
       from Don’t Stop Thinking:

  a:

      Yes! Despite most of our traffic being related to 5th Edition D&D, all tabletop

      #other-rpgs-talk and #video-gaming.

  q: Why can't I post images or embed links?

      Due to malicious user activity, links and images have been heavily restricted in

-
  q: What do the Staff do?
  a:
    - >
      Queen of the Tavern is the founder of the Tavern.
    - >
      Lords of the Tavern are Admins. In addition to the regular duties of an Innkeeper,
      each Lord brings something unique to the Tavern.
    - >
      Innkeepers have shown they are capable Moderators and are trusted with more
      responsibilities and given the ability to create channels and roles. They can act
      more autonomously than Bartenders, and help implement or temper the Lords’ ideas.
    - >
      Bartenders are Moderators in the Tavern, and like any good Bartender, they are
      great with people. They settle disputes that get out of hand, but more generally,
      they interact with the patrons, providing a good face for the Tavern.
    - >
      Advisors have no permissions or moderator abilities, they serve to help make
      decisions on moderation issues, and exist as a step prior to becoming a mod.
-
  q: ... how do I apply for staff here?
  a:
    - >
      Staff applications are currently closed.
    - >
      As most rosters often do, the Staff roster is prone to change. If you would like
      to show your interest in becoming a staff member, feel free to fill out the
      application for the Advisors role, which can be found within #announcements.
    - >
      Remember, we always are on the lookout for those with regular activity in the
      server who show kindness, consideration, and helpfulness.
-
  q: What is the Hall of Fame?
  a:
    - >
      The Hall of Fame is just that - a hall of fame for those users who have
      distinguished themselves from the crowd in some way. Users who are particularly
      funny, helpful, knowledgeable, clearheaded, or otherwise stand out may one day
      find that the staff have voted to give them a golden hero’s crest.
